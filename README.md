**Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures (Python)**

Control your computer mouse using hand gestures and a webcam—no physical mouse required.
This project combines computer vision and AI-based hand tracking to translate finger movements into real-time mouse actions.

Your hand becomes the controller. The webcam becomes the sensor. Science fiction, politely applied.

**Overview**

The Virtual Mouse detects hand gestures through a webcam and maps them to mouse operations such as cursor movement and clicking. It uses MediaPipe’s hand landmark detection to track finger positions accurately and PyAutoGUI to control the system mouse smoothly and reliably.

**Features**

Cursor Movement using index finger

Left Click using thumb + index finger

Right Click using thumb + middle finger

YES Gesture Detection (index + middle finger up)

Real-time hand tracking via webcam

Always-on-top camera preview window

Smooth cursor motion with jitter reduction

Click cooldown to prevent accidental clicks

ESC key to safely exit the program

**Technologies Used**

Python – Core programming language

OpenCV – Webcam access & image processing

MediaPipe – AI-based hand landmark detection

PyAutoGUI – Mouse control automation

NumPy – Numerical calculations

Math & Time – Gesture distance and cooldown handling

ctypes – Windows window behavior control

**Hand Gestures & Actions**
Gesture	    Action
Index finger up	Move mouse cursor
Thumb + Index close	Left click
Thumb + Middle close	Right click
Index + Middle up	YES gesture detected
ESC key	Exit program

**How It Works (Simple Flow)**

Webcam captures real-time video

MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks

Finger states (up/down) are analyzed

Landmark positions are mapped to screen coordinates

PyAutoGUI performs mouse actions

Smoothing and cooldown logic ensure stability

**Installation**

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-mouse.git
cd virtual-mouse

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy


⚠️ Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.

▶️ Run the Project
python virtual_mouse.py


A window titled “Virtual Mouse” will appear

Show your hand clearly in front of the webcam

Press ESC to exit

⚙️ Customization

You can tune performance by modifying these values in the code:

SMOOTHING = 5        # Cursor smoothness
FRAME_MARGIN = 50   # Hand movement boundary
CLICK_COOLDOWN = 0.5  # Delay between clicks


Increase SMOOTHING for steadier cursor movement

Adjust FRAME_MARGIN for comfortable hand range

🧠 Fun Fact

Your hand becomes a biological joystick, and the webcam becomes its nervous system.
Cyberpunk? Perhaps.
Useful? Definitely.
